## :package: Installation

> All installations are set up automatically in an out-of-the-box manner.

Run the command below:

```commandline
git clone https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/KISS-Matcher.git
cd KISS-Matcher
make deps
```

### C++

Run the command below. That's it.

```commandline
git clone https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/KISS-Matcher.git
cd KISS-Matcher
make cppinstall
```

__CHANGES__:
In order to be able to link the KISS-Matcher _c++_ lib to our shared lib project, [this CMakeLists.txt](cpp/kiss_matcher/CMakeLists.txt) has been edited in order to explicitly define that kiss-matcher should be compiled into a SHARED library. 

Because we are currently working with cmake 3.16, the robin.cmake file has been excluded from the main Makefile (Robin needs cmake >= 3.18). Robin should be installed from sources downgrading the cmake version.

After installing ROBIN, run:
```
git clone https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/KISS-Matcher.git
cd KISS-Matcher
make cppinstall_matcher_only
```

<details>
  <summary><strong>Q. How doest it work?</a></strong></summary>

The `cppinstall` command is encapsulated in the [Makefile](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/KISS-Matcher/blob/main/Makefile). and `cppinstall` calls `deps` to automatically install the dependencies.
In addition, KISS-Matcher requires [ROBIN](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/ROBIN).
But it's also automatically linked via [robin.cmake](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/KISS-Matcher/blob/main/cpp/kiss_matcher/3rdparty/robin/robin.cmake)

After installation, `kiss_matcher` and `robin` are placed in the installation directory using the following commands in the `Makefile`, respectively:
`	@$(SUDO) cmake --install cpp/kiss_matcher/build 	@$(SUDO) cmake --install cpp/kiss_matcher/build/_deps/robin-build    `

</details>

#### Example codes

We provide plentiful scalable registration examples. Please visit our [**cpp/example**](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/KISS-Matcher/tree/main/cpp/examples) directory and follow the instructions.

#### How To Use in Other Packages in C++?

See [CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/KISS-Matcher/blob/main/cpp/examples/CMakeLists.txt) in `cpp/examples`.

______________________________________________________________________

### Python

The prerequisites for Pybind11 are just the minimum requirements as follows:"

```
pip3 install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel scikit-build-core ninja cmake build
```

And then, run the following command:

```
pip3 install -e python/
```

We also provide out-of-the-box python registration examples. Go to [**python**](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/KISS-Matcher/tree/main/python) directory and follow the instructions.

## Acknowledgements

We sincerely express our gratitude to [Prof. Cyrill Stachnissâ€™ group](https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/index.html) at the University of Bonn for their generosity in allowing us to use the term *KISS*.
In particular, I (Hyungtae Lim) personally deeply appreciate [Tizziano Guadagnino](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5m73YFQAAAAJ&hl=it), [Benedikt Mersch](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XwuAB1sAAAAJ&hl=en), [Louis Wiesmann](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=EEyCOpIAAAAJ&hl=de), and [Jens Behley](https://jbehley.github.io/) for their kind support and collaboration during my time at the University of Bonn.
Without them, KISS-Matcher would not exist today. A special thanks goes to my co-author, [Nacho](https://github.com/nachovizzo), for taking the time to thoroughly teach me modern C++ and modern CMake.
We would also like to express our gratitude to [Kenji Koide](https://staff.aist.go.jp/k.koide/) for his exceptional effort in open-sourcing the wonderful open source, [small_gicp](https://github.com/koide3/small_gicp), which plays a crucial role in enhancing the efficiency of our pipeline.
His dedication to the research community continues to inspire and enable advancements in the field.

Again, their generosity, expertise, and contributions have greatly enriched our work, and we are truly grateful for their support.
